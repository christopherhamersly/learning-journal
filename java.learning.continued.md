# Java Expressions

## An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE 

## Operators
- ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS - 
Assign a value to a variable
color = 'beige';
The value of co 1 or is now beige. 

- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS - 
Perform basic math
area = 3 * 2;
The value of area is now 6. 

- STRING OPERATORS - 
Combine two strings
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';
The value of greeting is now Hi Molly. 

 - COMPARISON OPERATORS - 
Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se
buy = 3 > 5;
The value of buy is fa 1 se. 

- LOGICAL OPERATORS - 
Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se
buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);
The value of buy is now true. 

## Loops

#### A For loop uses a counter as a condition.  This instructs the code to run a specified number of times.  
> Initilization - Creat a vairable and set it to 0.  This variable is commonly called i, and it acts as the counter. 

> Condition: The loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number. 

> Update: Every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds one to the counter. 

## Key Loop Concepts :

1. Keywords : You will commonly see these two keywords used with loops. 
    > Break : this keyword causes the termination of the loop and tells the interpreter to go into the next statement of code outside of the loop.  
    
    >Continue : this keyword tells the interpreter to continue with the current iteration, and then check the condtion again. (if it is true the code runs again.)

## Evaluating Conditions 

### == - is equal to
### ! = - is not equal to
### === - strict equal to
### !=== - strict not equal to
### > - greater than
### < - less than
### >= - greater than or equal to
### <= - less than or equal to
### && - logical and
### || - logical or
### ! - logical not
