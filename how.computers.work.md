# How Computers Work

### Computers are everywhere

### They are a way to manipulate information

### The following are what they are used for 
>Storage

>Input

>Processing

>Output
### A computers processor takes information from memory and changes it using an algorithim, which is just a series of commands.  It then sends the processes of information back to be stored in memory again. This continues until the processed information is ready to be output.

## Binary and Data
> Binary is a sequence of 0's and 1's that a computer can understand as data

> A bit is the smallest piece of data a computer can store.  With more bits you can represent more complex information. 

> Instead of counting 10 for each next set of numbers, like we commonly use.  The binary system counts in two's.  1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ETC.
9 in binary is represented a 1001. 

> With eight wires you can store numbers between 0 and 255.  32 wires store from 0 to over 4 billion numbers. 

> Images are made up of smaller parts called pixels.  Each pixel is made up of a solid color.

> Sounds can be broked down into a series of numbers. 
***
## Circuits 
> Every input and ouput of a computer is a type of information, which can be represented by on or off electrical signals, or 1's and 0's.

> Computers use circuits to combine inputs for an output. 

> A "not" circuit gives you the opposite information back.  Will give you a 1 if you input a 0. 

> Complicated circuits take multiple signals & combine them to give different results. 

> An "and" circuit will work if both of the inputs are the same that the output is looking for. 

>An "adder" adds two bits together. Takes two individual bits and adds them together to calculate the sum. 

>Put circuits sid by side to add together much larger numbers. 

>The smaller the circuit is, the less distance it has to travel, making it faster.

### **Memory, Input & Output**
#### Input - Converts physical input to binary information
>Sensors are input devices
#### Memory - Stores information
#### CPU - Central processing unit calculates information
#### Output - Converts information to physcial output
##### Modern computers have multiple CPU's for faster output and many gigabytes of memory to store it.

### Hardware and Software
#### Circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs make up the hardware of the computer. 
#### Software is all of the programs running code on your computer. 
#### The CPU is the master chip that controls all of the other parts of the computer.  It knows which circuits to use and when to use them. 
#### Software tells the computer what to do. 
### The Operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
