## *Shortcuts*

***
 > ~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents
***
 > . (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory. eg in the example above we referred to Documents on line 4 with a relative path. It could also be written as ./Documents (Normally this extra bit is not required but in later sections we will see where it comes in handy).
 ***
 > .. (dotdot) - This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.
 ***
 > [tab] (tab) - This is a way to have your computer help you autofill your command. 
 ***
 > [pwd] - (Print working Directory) - Displays your current location in the CPU
 ***
 > [ls] - Shows the files that is around us
 ***
 > [d] - Directory
 ***
 > [-] - Normal File
 ***
 > cd [location] - change location
 ***
 > [.file] - hidden file
 ***
 > ls -a documents - shows hidden documents
